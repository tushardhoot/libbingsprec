If you want to leverage a speech-to-text API on devices 
like the Raspberry Pi, then this library is for you. While there 
are other similar libraries, all of them use Google's STT API 
which has a relatively small rate limit (50 queries/day). Bing's
public API, on the other hand, has a limit of 5,000 queries/month 
on the free tier, with the option to pay for more requests if 
needed.

Feel free to make improvements and submit pull requests!

How To Build:
